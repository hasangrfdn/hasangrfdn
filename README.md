## 🧠 About Me

I'm Hasan Gürfidan, a 3rd-year Computer Engineering student at Bursa Technical University.  
I’m passionate about software development, problem-solving, and continuously improving myself through hands-on projects.

I enjoy working on Dev, databases, algorithms, and fintech solutions. I have experience in languages like Python, C, Java, and PHP. I'm also interested in frontend development using HTML/CSS.  
I value collaboration, clear communication, and taking initiative in projects.

🚀 My vision is to contribute meaningfully to the evolution of technology as a creator, not just a follower
